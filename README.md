## HOW TO USE

### MARKING LOCATIONS

- Equip Mark spell
- Have a Runebook and Runestone in inventory
- Cast the spell at desired location
- The Runestone is consumed in the marking ritual, its essence becoming a permanent rune within your Runebook

### MANAGING DESTINATIONS

- Cast the Open Runebook lesser power
- Browse your marked locations
- Select a destination for recall
- Rename or delete unwanted locations with the Manage menu.

### RECALLING

- Cast Recall Rune spell
- Must have selected a destination via Runebook first
- Requires Runebook in inventory
- Cannot be used in combat (if enabled in settings)

## SETTINGS

Access via Open Runebook â†’ Settings:

- **Require Runestones:** Toggle reagent consumption for marking
- **Block Recall in Combat:** Prevent teleportation during combat, recommended for stability.
- **Reset All Settings:** Restore default configuration

## CRAFTING

Runestones can be crafted at any blacksmith forge:

- **Recipe:** 1 Soul Gem + 1 Void Salts = 1 Runestone
- Works with any size soul gem, minus black to avoid accidental consumption. The larger the soul gem, the more runestones the recipe yields.

## COMPATIBILITY
